Short line first.
This  is  a  very long line that should be formatted to fit within 80 characters
per   line   while   maintaining   word  boundaries  and  ensuring  proper  text
justification                           between                           words.
Medium length line here.
Another  extremely  long  line  that  needs  to be broken into multiple lines of
exactly  80 characters or less where the last character of each line should be a
letter              not              a              space             character.
Final short line.
